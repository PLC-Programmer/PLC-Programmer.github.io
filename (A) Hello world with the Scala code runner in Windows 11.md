<br/>

## Installations in Windows 11

First some notes on Scala installations for Windows 11. Install these components if not done yet:

#### a/ Scala 3

See https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/

As described in this document, run in a Windows termninal ("cmd.exe") this command: _> winget install virtuslab.scalacli_

When running Scala tools the first time in a Windows terminal, expect more downloads and installations, like with these commands:

_\> scala-cli_

_Welcome to Scala 3.6.4 (17.0.14, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM)._

_Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help._

_scala>_  # the Scala command prompt; type _:exit_ to leave it

<br/>

_\> scala_

_Welcome to Scala 3.6.4 (17.0.14, Java OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM)._

_Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help._

_scala>_

(the same output)
 
<br/>

Also make sure that these scala tools can be found in your Windows _PATH_ environment variable, for example like this:

_C:\Program Files\scala-cli-x86_64-pc-win32_

<br/>

_C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Coursier\data\bin_  -- this path came with the Scala installer for Windows based on Coursier: _cs-x86_64-pc-win32.exe_ from here: https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html#using-the-scala-installer-recommended-way

I just installed this too.

#### b/ Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

The installation process of the winget command is looking for an installed JVM on your Windows computer. This also happens when running the Scala installer for Windows based on Coursier (see above).

If a JRE (something like "Java 8 Update...") ist not yet existing on your computer, install it from here: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

I took the "Windows Offline (64-bit)" _jre-8u441-windows-x64.exe_ installation file:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/PLC-Programmer.github.io/blob/main/jre8.png)

Check the presence of Java from a Windows Terminal:

_\> java -version_

_java version "1.8.0_441"_

_Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_441-b07)_

_Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.441-b07, mixed mode)_

<br/>

Windows _PATH_ should now include these additional pathes:

_C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\java8path_

_C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath_

#### c/ sbt (simple build tool)

https://www.scala-sbt.org/download/: I think downloading and installing the _sbt-1.10.11.msi_ file is a good choice.

#### d/ C/C++ compiler for Scala native

Optional and only needed when building so called "Scala native" app's for Windows: install the _cl.exe_ compiler from a "C++ Workload" with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170

Open a Windows Terminal and test the presence of this compiler like this for example:

_\> cl_

_Microsoft (R) C/C++-Optimierungscompiler Version 19.43.34809 f√ºr x64_

_Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. Alle Rechte vorbehalten._

...

Again, make sure that the _cl.exe_ file can be found in your _PATH_:

_C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.43.34808\bin\Hostx64\x64_

<br/>

### Another Best Practice: own project (root) directory

Be it in Windows or Linux, best practice is to have a **dedicated directory for every project and for every tool/IDE** you use to make Scala based programs.

This is specifically true when doing a Scala project with the sbt. There it's quasi essential, because only one Scala source code file with the needed _main_ entry point is allowed in one project.

<br/>

## (A) Hello world with the Scala code runner in Windows 11 (and Ubuntu 24 LTS)

So, first create a project directory (be it in Windows or Linux). I call it _hello_world_for_scala_code_runner_.

Then change into this directory.

In this directory make this Scala source code file, called _hello_world_for_scala_code_runner.scala_:

```
//> using scala 3.6.4
@main def helloWorld() = println("Hello, world from the Scala code runner!")
```

Compile for the JVM:
_\> scala hello_world_for_scala_code_runner.scala_

_Compiling project (Scala 3.6.4, JVM (17))_

_Compiled project (Scala 3.6.4, JVM (17))_

**_Hello, world from the Scala code runner!_**

We are done! Program works and we all can go home :smiley:

<br/>
	
The same for works fine on Ubuntu 24 LTS:

_$ scala hello_world_for_scala_code_runner.scala_

_Starting compilation server_

_Compiling project (Scala 3.6.4, JVM (11))_

_Compiled project (Scala 3.6.4, JVM (11))_

_Hello, world from the Scala code runner!_

_$_

<br/>

_scala_ is also a build tool. After building for _hello_world_for_scala_code_runner.scala_ it created two hidden directories:

_.bsp_

_.scala-build_

_.bsp_ for Build Server Protocol contains file _scala.json_ to make this compiled project also available for other IDEs (Integrated development environments) and build tools. So, at an IDE this file has to be imported.

Directory _.scala-build_ contains these directories for example:

_.bloop_

_hello_world_for_scala_code_runner_148aa65560-66206329de_

..and these files:

_ide-envs.json_

_ide-inputs.json_

_ide-launcher-options.json_

_ide-options-v2.json_

This build makes our Scala program running much faster at the next execution:

_$ scala hello_world_for_scala_code_runner.scala_

_Hello, world from the Scala code runner!_

No more compilation was needed now.

_.bloop_ was obviously made with the Bloop build server tool: https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/
