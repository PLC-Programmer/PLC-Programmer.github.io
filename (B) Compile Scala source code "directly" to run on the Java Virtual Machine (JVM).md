# (B) Compile Scala source code "directly" to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Again, have a dedicated project (root) directory for this source code file, named _hello_world_for_java.scala_:

```
object hello_world_for_java:
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println("Hello, world for Java!")
```

Compile it on Windows 11 and run it on the JVM like this:

_> scalac hello_world_for_java.scala_

The Scala compiler generated these 3 files in the same (Windows) directory:

_hello_world_for_java$.class_

_hello_world_for_java.class_

_hello_world_for_java.tasty_

<br/>

Two more files are needed to make the _java_ command run:

_scala-library.jar_

_scala-reflect.jar_

I copied these Java Archive files from my Windows installation of Scala: _<my Windows Home dir>\.sbt\boot\scala-2.12.20\lib_ to the project root directory, that is here the same directory as the Scala source code file and run:

_> java -cp .\scala-library.jar;.\scala-reflect.jar;.\ hello_world_for_java_

**_Hello, world for Java!_**

The -cp option is for the class search path of directories and zip/jar files; see: _> java_

The real "trick" here is to also consider the relative path _.\_ at the class search path of directories!

<br/>

By the way: copy these two _.jar_ files also to your **Linux machine**, when you want to run there _java -cp .._ commands but cannot find these two files from a Linux installed Java Runtime Environment so easily. These _.jar_ files are portable from OS to OS.
