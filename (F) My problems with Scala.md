# (F) My problems with Scala

1/ Scala source code: does a character or string have symbolic or literal meaning?

(TBD: example)

2/ Scala source code: do the keywords _val_ and _var_ refer to the immutability and mutability, respectively, of the related objects or the values inside these objects?

3/ 3rd party library imports: how to make them working when only using the Scala code runner? So far, I got them only runnung when using the sbt (simple build tool).

4/ Scala source code: a loop with a syntax like this _...r <- 0 to RUNS..._ is inklusive on both sides; so (RUNS) acts like a valid index value!!

When you come from the Python world etc. you are used to the semantics of having the loop only running like: 0,1,2,... , RUNS - 1 inclusively

5/ ...
