# (G) My problems with Scala

1/ Scala source code: does a character or string have symbolic or literal meaning?

(TBD: example)

2/ Scala source code: do the keywords _val_ and _var_ refer to the immutability and mutability, respectively, of the related objects or the values inside these objects?

3/ 3rd party library imports: how to make them working when only using the Scala code runner? So far, I got them only running when using the sbt (simple build tool).

4/ Scala source code: a loop with a syntax like this _...r <- 0 to RUNS..._ is inclusive on both sides; so (RUNS) acts like a valid index value!!

When you come from the Python world etc, you are used to the semantics of having the loop only running like: 0,1,2,... , RUNS - 1 (inclusively)

5/ [How to read from the console when executing JavaScript on node.js?](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/PLC-Programmer.github.io/blob/main/(F)%20From%20a%20Scala%20program%20to%20JavaScript%20for%20node.js.md#how-to-read-from-the-console-when-executing-javascript-on-nodejs)
