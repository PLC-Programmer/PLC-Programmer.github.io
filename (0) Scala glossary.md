# Glossary, symbols and names

$ = Bash prompt (Linux; here Ubuntu 24 LTS); standard user

\> = Windows Terminal prompt ("cmd.exe")

Very often, the same command should work 1:1 in Windows or Linux, or at least very similar.

------

$ coursier = "cs" = application and artifact manager to install Scala applications and setup your Scala development environment: https://get-coursier.io/, https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-overview

~.jar = Java Archive file

(JDK = Java Development Kit)

JRE = Java Runtime Environment: download from here: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

js = JavaScript

JVM = the OS-specific Java Virtual Machine, which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE); as the **Scala program default execution case**, the scalac compiler compiles into platform-independent **Java bytecode**, which can then be executed through interpretation of just-in-time compilation (JIT): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/ 

LLVM = "Low Level Virtual Machine": you don't need this; in Windows 11 you can use the _cl.exe_ compiler from a "C++ Workload" with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170); and in Linux you install the _clang_ compiler: $ sudo apt install clang

nodejs = node.js = open-source JavaScript runtime environment: https://nodejs.org/en/

$ sbt = simple build tool: https://www.scala-sbt.org/

$ scala = Scala code runner tool: https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html; it acts as a wrapper around the _scalac_ compiler

$ scala-cli = Scala shell, that is a command-line tool to interact with the Scala language: https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/

$ scalac = Scala compiler: https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/compiler-options/index.html

Vite = frontend build tool for web applications: https://vite.dev/ 

Yarn = one of the main JavaScript package managers: https://yarnpkg.com/
